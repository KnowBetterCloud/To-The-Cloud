# Just A Cloud Away
References for Cloud Best-Practices, Strategies, and Approaches - primarily AWS focused.  
A majority of the resources here are generalized (either towards "general regarding AWS" , or "general regarding Cloud").  That said, I have primary focus areas (Kubernetes, CI/CD-DevOps, AI/ML-GenAI) and I am including those references, as well.

Purpose:  A collection of references for AWS Cloud Best Practices  
Status:  Work In Progress (Sep 2023)
