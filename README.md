# To the Cloud...

References for Cloud Best-Practices, Strategies, and Approaches - primarily AWS focused.  
A majority of the resources here are generalized (either towards "general regarding AWS" , or "general regarding Cloud").  That said, I have primary focus areas (Kubernetes, CI/CD-DevOps, AI/ML-GenAI) and I am including those references, as well.

Purpose:  A collection of references for AWS Cloud Best Practices  
Status:  Work In Progress (Sep 2023)

## Training (from AWS)
[AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn) over 500 online digital courses 

## Training (not affiliated with AWS)
[Adrian Cantrill](https://learn.cantrill.io/) - I feel that Adrian has a great delivery, and dives in to topics so that I actually learn something (not simply to just pass an exam).  
[A Cloud Guru](https://learn.acloud.guru/home) (now part of PluralSight?) - I have had good luck, overall, using A Cloud Guru (ACG).  Some courses were not "great".  
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - **always** wait for them to offer some sort of sale.  Content is somewhat hit-or-miss, in my experience.  Overall, a learning platform worth looking in to, I feel.
